# Particular Finite Element Method
This is an implementation of the PFEM method for incompressible and weakly compressible newtonian flow in C++. It uses notably [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) for the remeshing and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) for linear algebra operations.
